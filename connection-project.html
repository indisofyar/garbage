						<h2 class="mt-0">Overview</h2>
						<p>"Daily Mind‚Äù is an activity based experience where users complete 3 activities each day aimed at improving mental health. It aims to be a free-to-access cross-platform mental health app that has low time commitment, is effective at improving the mental health of users and has limited barriers to usee.</p>
						<h2 class="mb-2 mt-5">Project Details</h2>
						<p>Purpose: Personal project</p>
						<p>Tasks: UX/UI Design, literature research, competitor analysis, motion design, graphic design, illustration and user interviews.</p>
						<p>Tools: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe After Effects, Figma and Protopie.</p>
						<h2>Project Motivation</h2>
						<p>I was initially motivated to do this project as I was previously on a panel helping to interview new youth peer educators at my previous workplace. One of the questions we asked was "What prominent issues do you think young people are currently facing?" Of the 4 interviewees, all of them noted youth mental health as a major factor. This made me consider the issue within my own networks and community.</p>
						<h2>Further problem research</h2>
						<p>I began by reading about the problem. I found that a cross-sectional study by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27688518/">Salahedin and Mason (2016)</a>, indicated that of the young adults in the U.K. experiencing poor mental health, many chose not to access mental health care. Over 67% of young adults reported, financial cost as a barrier to accessing mental health care. Similarly, 81.4% respondents reported feelings of shame associated with accessing mental health care.</p>

						<h2 class="mb-0">Competitor analysis</h2>
						<p>Organisations such as The Black Dog Institute, Headspace and the Calm App provided different methods of treating mental health through digital apps. The Apps Calm and Headspace were the largest players in the market with the most downloads comparatively however their main offering was providing meditation and mindfulness activities. They are both paid apps. Alternatively, The Black Dog Institute has an App which is still in testing for Australian University Students and is not yet released to the broader public. Their existing program, myCompass, is a 7-week learning program, but was negatively reviewed for its inability to provide "engaging features," as well as continuous use of text and lack of engaging imagery. Moodfit is another app with various mental health tools, however for this app users are required to put together a regime for themselves through various tools which could hinder return usage. <strong>I identified a gap in the market for an activity-based free-to-access cross-platform mental health app that has lower time commitment, and is easier to set up and get going with.</strong></p>

						<h2 class="mt-5">Research round 1: Identifying opportunities</h2>
						<p>I interviewed 3 people (over the phone and in-person) and surveyed 7 people within my target group of 20-29 year olds to understand when people felt they felt connected to eachother. I did this research after reading an article by <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/2cxb8/">Klussman et. al. (2021)</a> whose findings indicated that peoples sense of connection to themselves and to others are strong indicators of mental health. I wanted to explore this notion.</p>

						<h2>Testing, feedback and reflection</h2>
						<p>At this stage I showed the prototype to potential users and my UX mentor. I realised that these weren't the right solution, as users usually needed to be friends with another person to get the mental health benefits from experiencing connection with another person. Also, creating new activities to improve mental health was a large undertaking, and was likely out of scope and would likely be inneffective, as there are many existing activities which affect mental health positively which are backed up by mental health literature. I needed to gather more data points and understand the problem further.</p>

						<h1 class="mt-5 mb-0">Findings</h1>
						<p>From this I discovered that concept 2 was much more effective. Users were much more interested in a solution that they didn't have to do with a friend as they foresaw a lot of things not being well navigated in concept 1. They were much more interested in having something they could use flexibly in their own time.</p>

I started by mapping out what each day might look like, then proceeding to prototype it.</p>

						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>The Daily Mind project has been a great project which explored the potential for an ecompassing digital mental health activity pack. If this project were to be developed further, greater investment would need to be made into limiting risks associated with its use. For instance, might any of the activities cause more distress to certain groups of users. Additionally, an app such as this could benefit from further consultation by mental health professionals and their expertise would be keystone in its development. </p>
						<p>
						As well as this, features which encourage continued use would be added. These include: gamification through awards - perhaps the illustrations could be collected by users, a record of the daily learnings users receive and the ability to go back and read through these, and also notifications which encourage users throughout the day might be appropriate.</p>

						<p>Overall, this project has laid the foundation for what could likely be a valuable resource/tool for certain groups and aimed to provide a more pleasant/relevant user experience than many similar applications currently on the market. Through its implementation, individuals could have greater opportunity to improve their mental health and experience greater wellbeing.
