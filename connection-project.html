                                A cross-sectional study by Salahedin and Mason
                                (2016, p.6-7), indicated that of the young
                                adults in the U.K. experiencing poor mental
                                health, many chose not to access mental health
                                care. Over 67% of young adults reported,
                                financial cost as a barrier to accessing mental
                                health care. Similarly, 81.4% respondents
                                reported feelings of shame associated with
                                accessing mental health care.

                                I interviewed 3 people and surveyed 7 people
                                within my target group of 20-29 year olds to
                                understand when people felt they felt connected
                                to eachother. I did this research after reading
                                an article by
                                <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/2cxb8/"

                                strong indicators of mental health. This helped

                            <p>
                                Following rounds of testing, feedback and
                                reflection on these, I realised that these
                                weren't the right solution, as users usually
                                needed to be friends with another person to get
                                the mental health benefits from experiencing
                                connection with another person. Also, creating
                                new activities to improve mental health was a
                                big undertaking, and was likely out of scope and
                                would likely be inneffective, as there are many
                                existing activities which affect mental health
                                positively which are backed up by mental health
                                literature. I felt the need to do more research
                                to understand the problem a bit better before
                                proceeding.

                                discover user contexts as well as user pain

                                in a solution that they didn't have to do with a
                                friend as they foresaw a lot of things not being
                                well navigated in concept 1. They were much more
                                interested in having something they could use

                                Organisations such as The Black Dog Institute
                                (2022), Headspace (2022) and the Calm App (2022)
                                provide different methods of treating mental
                                health through digital apps. The Apps Calm and
                                Headspace were the largest players in the market
                                with the most downloads comparatively. They are
                                only focused on providing meditation and
                                mindfulness activities. Calm also provides a
                                short wellness course with a subscription. They
                                are both paid apps. Alternatively, The Black Dog
                                Institute has an App which is still in testing
                                for Australian University Students and is not
                                yet released to the broader public. Their
                                existing program, myCompass, is a 7-week
                                learning program, but was negatively reviewed
                                for its inability to provide "engaging
                                features," as well as continuous use of text and
                                lack of engaging imagery (MindToolsIo, 2016).
                                Moodfit (2022) is another app with various
                                mental health tools, however for this app users
                                are required to put together a regime for
                                themselves through various tools which could
                                hinder return usage.

                            <p>Unfortunately, for this particular project Figma's prototyping tools were not advanced enough and would require too much explanation to the user during testing, rather than providing an accurate portrayal of what a user flow might feel like. For this reason I decided to migrate my project to protopie.</p>

							<p>Upon conducting testing, several key things were discovered. 
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Users struggled with how broad the journalling activity was.</li>
								<li>Users enjoyed the gratitude and breathing exercise.</li>
								<li>Users wanted the option to select their own activities and many didn't notice the "Change Activity" button.</li>
								<li>Some users found the context of what they were doing a bit unclear.</li>
								<li>Users thought they would be more likely to use this if it were an app.</li>
								<li>Users claimed that the animations were anti-climactic on occasion.</li>
