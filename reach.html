            </h2>
			<p>
				Reach is an app that allows outreach workers to learn from each other through shared reflections. The platform enables workers to upload reviews of their sessions as a post, allowing others to comment, like, and share feedback. Through gamification - awards and badges-, access to learning opportunities - the available training sessions page - and an easy to navigate user interface, outreach workers have the opportunity to improve their professional skills. As a result, workers can provide higher quality outreach services.

			 <h2>Problem Space</h2>
						<p>Social workers, community service workers, and health workers often conduct outreach as part of their role. However, many barriers exist to effectively performing outreach including cultural differences, client receptiveness, communication technique, and numerous others. My background as a Sexual Health Peer Educator has provided me with first-hand experience of the benefits of conducting outreach as well as the challenges that come with it. With 62,200 Australian currently employed as Welfare Support Workers (<a href="https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/welfare-support-workers?occupationCode=4117">Australian Government Job Outlook, 2020</a>) and many of them conducting outreach, it is likely that improving outreach could improve general wellbeing for communities in Australia.

						<h3 class="mt-3">Interviews</h3>
						<h4>Court Outreach Network Director</h4>
						<p>To help inform my research I had a discussion with Maya, the Executive Director of the Court Network (CN). Maya discussed her experience of overseeing CN and discussed the comprehensive process provided to her volunteer outreach workers. The program provides volunteers with substantial training, post-outreach training sessions, and other support during the process.
						</p>
						<p>
						In terms of ways to improve outreach, Maya discussed her experience of coming to realise how important reflective practice was to providing support for her volunteers. Maya described how she implemented a 1-hour post outreach session conducted on her zoom which provided outreach workers with the opportunity to debrief and gain clarity around any events that had happened that day. In terms of common problems, Maya noted that it was common for volunteers to get "too passionate" and go above and beyond for their clients, which could sometimes have negative consequences. Similarly, she discussed how it was important to match the right worker to the right client.

							"Creating trainings for outreach workers can often be a time-consuming and resource heavy process. When appropriate, we enjoy being able to bring someone in externally to conduct training"

						<h4 class="mb-0" id="#research">Interview with co-worker </h4>
						<p class="lead"><i>Name changed to protect privacy</i></p>
							<p class="pt-3">
								I further enhanced my research through discussions with my coworker Susan about her experience on outreach. Susan has worked as a peer educator for more than 3 years now and conducted outreach to to communicate sexual health information messaging to young people.
							</p>
							<p>
								Susan discussed several logistical issues with conducting outreach. She noted that it could potentially be a good idea to more greatly tailor messages to targeted individuals/communities. This particular insight aligned with findings from Colwell and O'Keefe (<a href="https://iopn.library.illinois.edu/journals/jloe/article/view/818/705">2021, p.55</a>). Greater information about the context that the outreach is conducted could be useful. For instance, factors such as weather, whether the outreach is outdoors, and similar factors can affect outreach effectiveness. She also noted that gaining more feedback from clients about whether the outreach was effective could be a useful way to improve the process. Susan liked the idea of a digital solution which could share resources between organisations. 
							</p>
								
							<p class="lead">
								"I definitely think that a greater information, and training sharing between organisations conducting outreach could be beneficial. However, you need to be mindful of factors such as up-to-date information and making sure outreach workers can understand it easily."

						<h2 >Design Objectives</h2>
				
						<h3 class="pt-4">1. Improve how informed outreach workers are.</h3>
						<p>By improving how informed outreach workers through support and resources, there is potential for empowering outreach workers to make each interaction with clients more effective. More training and connection opportunities means that workers can learn from each-other faster making them better at providing information in an appropriate manner, dealing with difficult situations and improving work skills generally.</p>
						<h3>2.Provide a streamlined service for busy workers.</h3>
						<p>By providing a streamlined experience through a minimal and easy to navigate user interface, Reach has the potential to allow workers to complete outreach tasks at a more efficient rate. Reach's intuitive layout allows them to spend more time conducting outreach and being prepared for outreach and less time worrying about logistical aspects.</p>
